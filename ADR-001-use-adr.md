# ADR-001: Using ADR

## Context:
Why architects made decisions.

## Decision:
Use Architecture Decision Records, described by Michael Nygard. https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

## Consequences:
Use Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions made during the project. This approach will help track the rationale behind decisions, the context in which they were made, and the implications they have on the project.

### Pro:
- Improved Communication: ADRs will serve as a clear communication tool for current and future team members to understand architectural decisions and their rationales.
- Better Decision Making: The process of writing ADRs encourages thorough consideration of options, helping to ensure that decisions are well thought out.
- Historical Context: ADRs provide a historical record of decisions, allowing us to revisit and understand past decisions.

### Cons:
- Overhead: Writing and maintaining ADRs requires additional effort.
- Learning Curve: Significant learning curve associated with adopting the ADR process and format.
