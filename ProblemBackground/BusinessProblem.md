# Business Problem: Rising Complaint Volumes and Regulatory Pressure

## 1. Market Context

UK financial firms face high and persistent levels of customer complaints.

- The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) received **305,726 new complaints in 2024/25**, a **54 percent increase** on the previous year and the highest level for six years.  
- Complaints about hire purchase motor products rose from **21,441 in 2023/24** to **76,160 in 2024/25**. Complaints about credit cards increased from **24,402** to **60,364** over the same period.

At firm level, FCA aggregate data shows a large and steady flow of complaints.

- In **2024 H1**, firms received **1.86 million** complaints.  
- In **2024 H2**, firms received **1.78 million** complaints.  
- In **2025 H1**, complaints reached **1.85 million**, up **3.6 percent** on 2024 H2.

Since 2021, total complaints have remained between **1.7 and 2.0 million** every half year. Complaint volumes are no longer a short spike. They represent a structural workload that large firms must manage each day.

## 2. Regulatory Expectations and Risk

The regulatory bar for complaint handling has risen.

- FCA DISP rules require firms to maintain effective and transparent procedures, handle complaints promptly and fairly, and investigate competently and impartially.  
- The Consumer Duty, in force since July 2023, sets higher and clearer standards of consumer protection and requires firms to prioritise customer needs and deliver good outcomes.  
- The FCA continues to highlight weak complaint handling and poor root cause analysis across sectors, linking these issues directly to Consumer Duty outcomes.

In specific sectors, such as motor finance, regulators expect large scale redress and proactive handling.

- The FCA has proposed a motor finance redress scheme that may cover up to **14.2 million** agreements, with average payouts around **£700**.  
- FOS data shows record complaints about hire purchase motor products, which increases pressure on firms’ complaint processes.

Firms that fail to handle complaints at volume, meet regulatory timeframes, and maintain clear audit trails face the following risks.

- Breach of DISP rules and Consumer Duty  
- Enforcement action  
- Significant redress cost and operational strain  
- Loss of customer trust and reputational damage
